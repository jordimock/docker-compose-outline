# This file exists to include the vol/ directory in the Git repository.
# The vol/ directory is used to store dynamically generated data
# and is mounted as volumes for Docker containers.
#
# Important! The contents of this directory are NOT tracked by Git
# and SHOULD NOT be committed to the repository.
# The .gitkeep file ensures that the vol/ directory exists when the project is cloned.
#
# When making a backup, stop the containers and archive both .env and the vol/ directory:
# Example:
#   docker compose down
#   tar -czvf backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz .env vol/
#
# Never store sensitive or persistent data inside vol/ under Git version control!
